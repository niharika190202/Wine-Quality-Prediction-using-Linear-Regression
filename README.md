# Wine Quality Prediction Using Linear Regression
## Overview
The Wine Quality Prediction project employs Linear Regression to predict wine quality based on physicochemical attributes. This project analyzes a dataset of wine samples to build a predictive model that estimates wine quality scores, assisting in quality control and decision-making in the wine industry.

## Features
- Preprocessing of wine dataset
- Implementation of Linear Regression model
- Prediction of wine quality based on input features
- Evaluation of model performance with metrics
## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains wine samples with various physicochemical attributes and quality ratings. It can be downloaded from UCI Machine Learning Repository - Wine Quality Dataset.
